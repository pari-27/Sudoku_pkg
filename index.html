    <h3>How to play Sudoku</h3>
      <h4>
    <pre>
      The classic Sudoku game involves a grid of 81 squares. The grid is divided into nine blocks, each containing nine squares.

      The rules of the game are simple: 
      
      1. Each of the nine blocks has to contain all the numbers 1-9 within its squares. 
      
      2. Each number can only appear once in a row, column or box.
      
      3. The difficulty lies in that each vertical nine-square column, 
      
      or horizontal nine-square line across, within the larger square,
      
      must also contain the numbers 1-9, without repetition or omission.
      
      Every puzzle has just one correct solution.
